### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. I learned the differene between Java and JavaScript. JavaScript programs are interpreted in the browser, whereas Java programs are compiled and can be run as stand alone applications. Java is a strongly-typed language and JavaScript is a loosely-typed language.
2. I learned basic syntax rules for JavaScript. Which are: JavaScript is case-sensitive; JavaScript ignores extra whitespace within statements; Each JavaScript statement ends with a semicolon.
3. I learned three different data types: Primitive data types (Number: integer & floating-point numbers; Boolean: true or false; String: a sequence of alphanumeric characters), Composite/Complex data types (Object: a named collection of data; Array: a sequence of values), and Special data types (Null: the only value is "null"; Undefined: the only value is "undefined")
